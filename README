NAME
    Types::Encodings - type constraints for Bytes and Chars

DESCRIPTION
    Additional type constraints and coercions to complement Types::Standard.

  Type constraints
    "Str"
        Alias for Types::Standard type constraint of the same name.

    "Bytes"
        Strings where "utf8::is_utf8()" is false.

    "Chars"
        Strings where either "utf8::is_utf8()" is true, or each byte is
        below 0x7F.

  Coercions
    "Encode[`a]"
        Coercion to encode a character string to a byte string using
        "Encode::encode()". This is a parameterized type coercion, which
        expects a character set:

           use Types::Standard qw( Bytes Encode );
   
           has filename => (
              is     => "ro",
              isa    => Bytes + Encode["utf-8"],
              coerce => 1,
           );

    "Decode[`a]"
        Coercion to decode a byte string to a character string using
        "Encode::decode()". This is a parameterized type coercion, which
        expects a character set.
